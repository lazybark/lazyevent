# lazyevent
LazyEvent - easy to use logger package that can be
customized for almost any app. It treats events as objects with properties that can
                                    be created, modified, and logged (or not). An event is any event during runtime,
                                    and its possible to prepare
                                    record in advance and then use as template. Multiple logging
                                    of the same event will generate unique ID for every log record to avoid ambiguity.
                                    Time of event can be fixed or updated each time the template is logged.
